## Workflow #1: Add Affiliate Links to Existing Posts

### Your 2Performant Merchants (Active):

- **SpringFarma.com** - Health supplements (6%)
- **evoMAG.ro** - Electronics (4%)

### Strategy: Contextual Affiliate Placement

**Use Case 1: Find posts about death dreams → Add book links**

```
"List all inteles.ro posts that mention 'moarte' or 'înmormântare' or 'deces'"

[Claude shows you 12-15 posts]

"For each of these posts, add this HTML at the bottom:

<div style='border:1px solid #ddd; padding:16px; border-radius:8px; margin:24px 0;'>
<h3 style='margin:0 0 12px;'>Resurse recomandate</h3>
<p style='margin:0 0 10px;'><strong>📚 Dicționar de vise</strong> - Interpretări complete pentru visele despre moarte și pierdere</p>
<a href='YOUR_LIBRIS_AFFILIATE_LINK' style='display:inline-block; padding:10px 20px; background:#2563eb; color:white; text-decoration:none; border-radius:6px;'>Vezi cartea pe Libris.ro</a>
<p style='margin-top:12px; font-size:0.85rem; color:#666;'>Link afiliat - Câștigăm un mic comision fără costuri pentru tine.</p>
</div>

Only add if the post doesn't already have this box."
```

**Expected Result:**
- 12-15 posts updated in 30 seconds
- Relevant affiliate placement
- Romanian legal disclosure included
- Mobile-optimized HTML

---

### Use Case 2: Sleep-related posts → SpringFarma products

```
"Find posts about 'somn', 'insomnie', 'trezire', or 'coșmar'"

[Shows 20-30 posts]

"Add this section before the conclusion:

<div style='background:#f0fdf4; border-left:4px solid #22c55e; padding:16px; margin:24px 0;'>
<h3 style='margin:0 0 12px;'>💤 Pentru un somn mai bun</h3>
<p><strong>Magneziu glicinat</strong> - Ajută la relaxare și somn profund</p>
<a href='YOUR_SPRINGFARMA_AFFILIATE_LINK'>Vezi pe SpringFarma.com</a>
<p style='margin-top:8px; font-size:0.85rem; color:#666;'>Link afiliat</p>
</div>"
```

---

### Use Case 3: Bulk audit - Find posts WITHOUT affiliate links

```
"Scan all inteles.ro posts and tell me:
1. How many posts have NO affiliate links
2. Group them by topic (death, animals, water, falling, etc.)
3. Suggest which 2Performant merchant fits each topic"
```

**Claude will analyze and give you:**
```
Found 127 posts without affiliate links:

Death/loss topics (18 posts):
→ Suggest: Libris psychology books

Sleep/nightmares (24 posts):
→ Suggest: SpringFarma supplements + Flanco sleep tech

Animal dreams (31 posts):
→ Suggest: Books about symbolism

Water/falling (15 posts):
→ Suggest: Relaxation products

Etc...
```

Then you decide which batch to monetize first.

---

## Workflow #2: Mobile Optimization (97.5% Traffic!)

### Problem:
Mobile users scroll fast, leave quickly, need clear value immediately.

### Solution:
Mobile-first content structure with "quick answer" boxes.

```
"For the top 20 traffic posts on inteles.ro:

1. Add this quick answer box right after the title:

<div style='background:#fef3c7; border:2px solid #f59e0b; padding:16px; border-radius:8px; margin:16px 0;'>
<strong>🔍 Răspuns rapid:</strong> [2-3 sentence summary of the dream meaning]
</div>

2. Break long paragraphs into shorter ones (max 3-4 lines each)

3. Add clear H2 headings every 200-300 words

4. Place first affiliate link after the quick answer box (capture users before they bounce)

5. Add a second affiliate link at the bottom

Show me each post before updating so I can approve."
```

**Why this works:**
- Mobile users get instant value (reduces bounce rate)
- Affiliate link is above the fold (more clicks)
- Better UX = better Google rankings
- 97.5% mobile traffic = huge impact

---

## Workflow #3: Create New Monetized Content

### Strategy: AI-Generated Posts with Built-in Monetization

```
"Create 5 new draft posts for inteles.ro about these trending dream topics:

1. 'Ce înseamnă când visezi că te îneci' (drowning dreams)
2. 'Vis despre bani găsiți pe stradă' (finding money)
3. 'Visul cu câini care mușcă' (dog biting dreams)
4. 'Visul cu foști iubiți - interpretare psihologică' (ex-lover dreams)
5. 'Ce înseamnă când visezi că zbori fără aripi' (flying dreams)

For each post:
- Write 400-500 words (Romanian)
- Mobile-optimized structure (quick answer box at top)
- Include 2 affiliate links:
  * Libris book link after 200 words
  * SpringFarma product at end
- SEO optimized for keyword 'vis despre [topic]'
- Romanian affiliate disclosure
- Add as DRAFT (I'll review before publishing)

Use this template:
[Title]
[Quick answer box - 2-3 sentences]
[150 words intro]
[Affiliate: Relevant book]
[200 words detailed interpretation]
[H2: Interpretări în funcție de detalii]
[Bullet list: 3-5 variations]
[Affiliate: Sleep product if relevant]
[Conclusion: 50 words]
[Disclosure footer]"
```

**Result:**
- 5 monetized posts ready in 2 minutes
- You review, edit, publish
- Each post has 2 revenue opportunities
- SEO-optimized for Romanian keywords

## Workflow #5: Email Capture for Long-term Revenue

### Strategy:
Capture 1-2% of daily traffic (4-8 emails/day) → Build list → Promote affiliate products via email.

```
"Add this email capture popup to all inteles.ro posts with >50 comments or high traffic:

[HTML for Mailchimp/ConvertKit popup]

Configuration:
- Show after 30 seconds OR 50% scroll
- Mobile-optimized
- Offer: 'Ghid gratuit: 50 de vise frecvente și semnificațiile lor'
- Copy: 'Primește interpretări noi direct în inbox'
- Only show once per user (cookie-based)"
```

**Revenue model:**
- Capture 5 emails/day = 150/month
- Email list of 1,800 in 1 year
- Send weekly digest + affiliate products
- 5% click-through × 10% conversion = €50-150/month extra

---

## Workflow #6: Content Calendar & Consistency

### Automate posting schedule

```
"Create a content calendar for inteles.ro:

- 3 new posts per week (Mon, Wed, Fri)
- Topics from high-search-volume Romanian keywords
- Each post has affiliate links + email capture
- Publish at 9 AM Romanian time

Generate 4 weeks of topics now, formatted as:

Week 1:
- Mon: [topic] → [keyword] → [affiliate product]
- Wed: [topic] → [keyword] → [affiliate product]
- Fri: [topic] → [keyword] → [affiliate product]

..."
```

Then each week:
```
"Write and schedule this week's 3 posts from the content calendar"
```

**Consistency = compounding revenue.**

---

## Workflow #7: Performance Tracking

### Monthly Revenue Audit

```
"For inteles.ro in October 2025:

1. List all posts with affiliate links
2. Identify posts with most comments (proxy for engagement)

4. Suggest posts to update/optimize based on seasonal trends

Then create a report:
- Total posts with affiliates: X

```

**Monthly actions based on report:**

## Romanian Legal Compliance

### ANPC Requirements for Affiliate Marketing

**Required:**
✅ Clear disclosure BEFORE click
✅ Text like: "Link afiliat" or "Link de afiliere"
✅ Visible on mobile (min 12px font)
✅ Can't mislead users

**Good examples:**
```html
<p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:#666;">
Link afiliat - Câștigăm un mic comision dacă achiziționați prin acest link, fără costuri suplimentare pentru dvs.
</p>
```

**Bad examples:**
❌ No disclosure
❌ Hidden in footer
❌ "Promoted" (too vague)
❌ After click (too late)

### GDPR for Tracking

If using tracking cookies:
- Add cookie banner
- Privacy policy must mention affiliate tracking
- Users can opt out

**2Performant tracking is cookie-based**, so technically you need consent. Most Romanian sites use cookie banners via plugins:
- Cookie Notice & Compliance
- GDPR Cookie Consent

## Questions & Troubleshooting

**Q: How do I know which posts are high-traffic?**
A: Install Google Analytics or use WordPress plugins like MonsterInsights. Or check Google Search Console.

**Q: What if affiliate links break?**
A: Run monthly audit: "Check all affiliate links on inteles.ro"

**Q: Should I disclose on every post or site-wide?**
A: Both - site-wide in footer + per-post near each link (Romanian law requires per-link disclosure)

**Q: Can I use Amazon Associates for Romanian traffic?**
A: Yes, but Amazon.de or Amazon.it (not Amazon.com). Conversion is lower than local merchants like Libris/eMAG.

**Q: How long until I see revenue?**
A: 2Performant pays ~60 days after transaction. First earnings: Month 3. Consistent revenue: Month 6+.
