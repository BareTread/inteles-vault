## 🎓 Why This System Works

### The €5,000/Month Discovery

**Key insight:** Quality > quantity. Trust = long-term revenue.

**After:** Regular merchant URLs → Link2 auto-converts → Zero errors → 100% tracking

**Key insight:** Automation eliminates human error. Simplicity = reliability.

**Key insight:** Constraints enable creativity within proven frameworks.
